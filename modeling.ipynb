    "In an era where data-driven decision-making is transforming industries, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful tools for forecasting and strategic planning. This project presents a comprehensive approach to sales forecasting developed in response to a real-world challenge provided by Siemens Advanta Consulting—a digital transformation leader within the Siemens group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the challenge is to forecast the monthly sales performance of selected product groups from one of Siemens’ business units in Germany. The historical dataset consists of daily sales figures, enriched with relevant macroeconomic indicators, spanning from October 2018 to April 2022. The forecasting models are evaluated against actual sales data from May 2022 to February 2023, using root mean square error (RMSE) as the primary performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging AI-based techniques, this project aims to demonstrate how machine learning models can enhance forecasting accuracy, minimize the need for manual intervention, and reduce the potential for human bias. The outcome not only serves as a valuable benchmark for predictive performance but also highlights the practical application of AI in solving real business challenges. \n",

    "Smart Infrastructure helps customers through their digital transformation journey by leveraging cutting-edge technology that enables clients to adapt to evolving environments and to seize new opportunities. It mostly provides B2B services, focusing on energy efficiency and resource optimization, which in turn improves clients’ asset performance, availability, reliability, and operational efficiency.

    "`Overall economic conditions`\n",
    "In 2018, advanced countries saw GDP growth of 2.3%, mainly due to the U.S. economy benefiting from tax cuts. In contrast, emerging countries' GDP growth fell slightly from 4.7% to 4.6%, affected by capital outflows and currency depreciation, notably in Argentina and Turkey. This decline was worsened by U.S. monetary tightening and fears of a global trade war from new tariffs. Political tensions increased in the Middle East, particularly with U.S. sanctions on Iran. In Europe, uncertainties around the U.K.'s exit from the EU and worries about Italy’s budget led to negative investment sentiment. All in all, the economic acceleration at the beginning of 2018 lost steam towards the end of the year due to these adverse effects.\n",

    "`Energy Management`\n",
    "The Energy Management Division offers a wide spectrum of software, products, systems, solutions, and services for transmitting, distributing and managing electrical power and for providing intelligent power infrastructure.\n",
    "This sector faces competition from large multinational companies and fast-growing firms in emerging countries. It generally benefits from major trends, in particular decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization. Although Energy Management reported a double-digit order decline, due to a sharply lower volume of large orders in the transmission solutions business, revenue grew in most Division’s businesses, led by the power distribution businesses. For the latter, on a geographic basis, higher revenue in the region Asia, Australia was partially offset by a decline in the Americas strongly influenced by currency headwinds, while revenue in the region Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East was flat year-over-year.\n",

The Division offers products, solutions, services and software for fire safety, security, building automation and energy management.\n",
    "The Division competes with multinational companies, system integrators, local firms, and IT startups. Strong competition is causing price pressure, especially in the solutions business. Economic changes affect the Division's activities with delay, and particularly in non-residential construction markets, there is a time lag of two to four quarters. Key trends include the demand for energy efficiency and smart space solutions to improve comfort and productivity. In fiscal 2018, the Building Technologies acquired three startups to strengthen its portfolio and expertise. Revenue increased, with the Division’s revenue growing faster than the market on increases in all reporting regions, with strongest market growth contributions came from the Asia, Australia region, particularly including India. Orders grew in the region Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East, driven by double-digit growth in Germany including multiple multi-year service contracts. The Division won major orders in the U. S. in both periods under review. Profit and profitability remained strong, supported by economies of scale and improved productivity. The markets are expected to grow solidly in fiscal 2019, although U.S. growth may slow slightly.\n",

    "`Digital Factory`\n",
    "The Digital Factory Division provides a wide range of automation products and solutions for manufacturing, including software, control systems, motors, and integrated systems. It also offers lifecycle services and software for design and testing. Changes in customer demand are strongly driven by macroeconomic cycles, leading to variations in profitability. Competition is mainly from large multinational firms offering a relatively broad portfolio, and companies that are only active in certain geographic or product markets. Key trends include rising interest rates, which will limit investment but at the same time make it more focused on improving efficiency, a shift towards regionalization solutions, either to protect local economies or to better adapt solutions to local needs, and an increased focus on digitalization for competitiveness. The Division reported year-over-year growth in orders and revenue, especially in software. Growth was strongest in the Americas and Asia, notably China, and customer investments grew faster than their production, underlining a clear growth momentum relating to automation and digitalization. While the market is expected to continue growing, slower demand is anticipated for 2019 due to the high investment levels of 2018 and rising global trade tensions.\n",

    "`Overall economic conditions`\n",
    "After GDP growth of 3.2% in 2018, it is expected to drop to 2.6% in 2019, as to the U.S.-China trade dispute and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East contributed to uncertainty, which weighed on capital investments. Global exchange of goods started to decline from October 2018, leading to near-stagnation of industrial production afterwards. The decline affected regions reliant on trade and industry, particularly Germany and Italy in Europe, Mexico and Canada in the Americas, and India in Asia. In addition, European economies suffered from continued uncertainties regarding the U. K. leaving the European Union (Brexit) and the budget clash between the European Commission and Italy’s government, both weighing especially on business investment environment. Countries dependent on commodities and raw material exporting, notably Chile, Brazil and Argentina, saw declines in commodity prices in addition to other adverse factors including domestic political and financial instability. Advanced countries are expected to grow by 1.6%, 0.7 percentage points lower than 2018, while emerging countries will see a decline from 4.6% to 4.1%.\n",

    "`Smart Infrastructure`\n",
    "Smart Infrastructure brings together energy supply – from intelligent control across the grid and low- and medium-voltage electrification and control products – with building technology, targeting high-growth areas like energy storage, electric vehicle infrastructure, and microgrids at the grid edge. It reaches customers through multiple channels, including global sales, distributors, OEMs, resellers, installers, and direct sales via regional branch offices. Its diverse customer base encompasses infrastructure developers, construction firms, public and commercial buildings, utilities, and heavy industries. Smart Infrastructure faces competition from large multinationals, smaller manufacturers, local integrators, and facility management firms. Economic changes impact customer demand differently, with discrete manufacturing reacting quickly and strongly with macroeconomic cycles, while other sectors - infrastructure, construction, heavy industries and the utilities – have a slower response to economic cycles. Key trends include rising population and urbanization, the need for safe and sustainable environments, and decarbonization, growing decentralization and prosumers’ influence.

Global GDP is expected to fall by 4.5% in 2020, following a growth of 2.6% in 2019. Economic activity was already decelerating due to the U.S.-China trade conflict, but economic sentiment indicators were starting to improve in response to calming of the conflict ( “phase one deal”). Then COVID-19 emerged and started to spread globally, resulting in strict social distancing measures that limited operations, especially in contact-heavy sectors. Many other industries were directly affected by supply chain problems or indirectly by insufficient demand and stopped production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Governments and central banks responded with strong fiscal and monetary policies to support businesses and households, leading to a brief economic rebound in the summer. However, renewed virus outbreaks hindered full recovery and restrictions in high contact industries made the economy operate only at about 90% of its full potential, with advanced economies projected to see a 5.5% decline in GDP. Siemens experienced mixed impacts across its sectors, benefiting from growth in technology-related areas, while facing challenges in customer access and sales. While the pandemic significantly slowed our sales and service activities, this also resulted in cost reductions such as lower travel and marketing expenses. Furthermore, we were able to keep our production largely stable due to the use of our own technology in our factories and our diversified value chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Smart Infrastructure`\n",
    "Smart Infrastructure’s businesses are impacted by changes in the overall economic environment to varying degrees, depending on customer segment. Particularly in its solutions and service business, it is affected by changes in the non-residential building construction markets with a time lag of two to four quarters.\n",
    "Smart Infrastructure is experiencing a decline in orders, particularly in the solutions and services business, which previously saw a higher volume of orders. The products business showed only a slight decrease, while orders in the systems and software business stayed stable. Overall, revenue for the solutions and services business and for the systems and software business remained close to the prior- year levels. The drop in orders and revenue primarily came from Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia and Australia, but the Americas remained stable.\n",
    "Demand in Smart Infrastructure markets declined moderately due to COVID-19, especially in the automotive, oil and gas, and machine-building sectors. However, energy performance services and the data center market grew due to the increased focus on energy efficiency, digital services and remote work. \n",
    "Market development will be affected by lower demand from building construction, leading to a slight decline in volume of markets served by Smart Infrastructure year-over-year. Asia and Australia are expected return to normal growth, while Europe and the U.S. may see declines.\n",

    "`Overall economic conditions`\n",
    "In fiscal 2021, the global economy was heavily influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and its many repercussions. After a GDP contraction in 2020, a strong recovery is expected in 2021. The economy grew rapidly in the third quarter of 2020 after the first wave of COVID-19. Despite fears of a new recession due to subsequent COVID-19 waves, economic activity had already adapted, supported by significant stimulus measures in Europe and the U.S.\n",
    "Central banks gave support with expansionary measures, while short-term interest rates were at or near zero. Accordingly, the global economy continued to expand also in the fourth quarter of calendar 2020 and the first quarter of calendar 2021, despite renewed outbreaks and lockdowns. In December 2020, the first countries approved new COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
    "However, momentum weakened in early 2021 due to rising infections and the more contagious Delta variant. Vaccination efforts lagged, especially in emerging countries, while supply disruptions affected many sectors, leading to logistics bottlenecks that disrupted value chains from raw materials to high-tech goods, especially semiconductors, and caused extraordinary disruptions in global logistics systems. High demand for goods, driven by consumer savings, contributed to increased producer and energy prices,  resulting in elevated rates of inflation. \n",
    "The Chinese economy – with the world’s largest manufacturing sector –  particularly benefited from global demand. However, tensions in the property sector and energy shortages weighed on economic activity in the second half of calendar 2021. \n",
    "Overall, major economies experienced strong rebounds, and GDP is expected to grow strongly.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Smart Infrastructure`\n",
    "Smart Infrastructure is benefitting from several positive trends, including urbanization, demographic changes, climate change, and digitalization. Urbanization and demographic shifts create a demand for smarter buildings, while climate change pushes for decarbonization and the development of flexible energy infrastructures. Digitalization enables the improvement of building efficiency and electricity management with more renewable energy sources.\n",
    "Orders for Smart Infrastructure improved across all sectors, with notable growth in the products and systems businesses, driven by demand from industrial customers and contracts from U.S. semiconductor manufacturers. Revenue also grew, although the solutions and services business saw a slight decline due to negative currency translation effects. Meanwhile, supply chain challenges were managed effectively, preventing major disruptions.\n",
    "Overall, markets served by Smart Infrastructure grew moderately in fiscal 2021, experiencing a recovery from COVID-19-related effects that had a strong impact on most customer industries a year earlier.\n",
    "Smart Infrastructure also experienced a number of supply chain constraints, especially in the areas of base metals (copper, aluminum, steel), plastics, semiconductors and transportation services. Whereas the management of these constraints required additional effort, Smart Infrastructure’s supply chains have proven to be resilient, so that major interruptions could be avoided, and delivery ability was maintained.\n",
    "Market growth is expected to accelerate, primarily fueled by demand in the pharmaceutical sector, data centers, and utilities. Growth will be strongest in Asia and Australia. Growth in the region Europe, C.I.S., Africa, and the Middle East is expected to accelerate and markets in the region Americas are expected to return to growth.\n",

    "`Overall economic conditions`\n",
    "In fiscal 2022, global economic growth faced major disruptions from the war in Ukraine, the effects of COVID-19, and the economic slowdown in China. After a strong recovery in 2021, GDP growth is expected to decline as the economic rebound ended abruptly. In late 2021, increased vaccinations and reduced restrictions boosted consumer spending, triggering inflationary pressures, especially in the U.S. and Europe. Supply chain issues, labor shortages, and heightened energy prices contributed to this inflation, while large stimulus packages and high household savings fueled it. \n",
    "The war in Ukraine further strained economies in early 2022, causing another significant rise in energy prices, which heavily impacted Europe and industrial sectors, especially energy-intensive industries such as chemicals. The war in Ukraine put further pressure on developing economies, especially in the Middle East, Africa, and Turkey, as both Russia and Ukraine were major exporters of grain and fertilizer before the war.\n",
    "China’s zero-COVID strategy became even more strict with the emergence of the Delta variant and the highly infectious Omicron variant, which hindered economic activity, along with regulations affecting growing sectors and a recession in real estate. Consequently, China's growth was predicted to slow. \n",
    "In response to rising inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates and tightened monetary policy, followed by other central banks. This led to economic disruptions, resulting in slower-than-expected GDP growth for 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Smart Infrastructure`\n",
    "In fiscal 2022, Smart Infrastructure acquired Brightly Software Inc., improving its position in software for asset and maintenance management. Smart Infrastructure’s businesses are impacted by changes in the overall economic environment to varying degrees. Especially, demand for service offerings shows only limited influence from macroeconomic cycles.\n",
    "Orders and revenue grew significantly across all businesses, especially in electrical products and electrification, driven by industrial customers, data centers, and proactive purchasing. Smart Infrastructure faced supply chain challenges but avoided major disruptions. The Americas region saw the strongest growth, while Asia and Australia were hindered by COVID-19 impacts, particularly in China. Both order and revenue development included positive currency translation effects. \n",
    "Overall, markets served by Smart Infrastructure grew clearly in fiscal 2022. Market growth is anticipated to be slightly slower due to ongoing inflation and supply chain issues, with solid demand expected in data centers and power distribution despite challenges like price increases and geopolitical tensions.\n",
    "Market development is expected to continue to be influenced by supply chain constraints and effects from the war in Ukraine, including on energy prices. Further impacts could arise from potential lockdown measures in China and geopolitical tensions."
