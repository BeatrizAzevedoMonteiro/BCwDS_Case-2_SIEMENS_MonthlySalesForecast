    "In October 2018, Siemens launched its Smart Infrastructure division, as part of the implementation of an optimized corporate structure. This new division emerged from the merger of former divisions, specifically the power distribution segment of the Energy Management division, the Building Technologies‚Äô business, and the control products business of the Digital Factory division.\n",
    "Smart Infrastructure helps customers through their digital transformation journey by leveraging cutting-edge technology that enables clients to adapt to evolving environments and to seize new opportunities. It mostly provides B2B services, focusing on energy efficiency and resource optimization, which in turn improves clients‚Äô asset performance, availability, reliability, and operational efficiency. All in all, this division future-proofs infrastructures, fostering collaborative ecosystems.\n",

    "`Overall economic conditions`\n",
    "In 2018, advanced countries saw GDP growth of 2.3%, mainly due to the U.S. economy benefiting from tax cuts. In contrast, emerging countries' GDP growth fell slightly from 4.7% to 4.6%, affected by capital outflows and currency depreciation, notably in Argentina and Turkey. This decline was worsened by U.S. monetary tightening and fears of a global trade war from new tariffs. Political tensions increased in the Middle East, particularly with U.S. sanctions on Iran. In Europe, uncertainties around the U.K.'s exit from the EU and worries about Italy‚Äôs budget led to negative investment sentiment. All in all, the economic acceleration at the beginning of 2018 lost steam towards the end of the year due to these adverse effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Energy Management`\n",
    "The Energy Management Division offers a wide spectrum of software, products, systems, solutions, and services for transmitting, distributing and managing electrical power and for providing intelligent power infrastructure.\n",
    "This sector faces competition from large multinational companies and fast-growing firms in emerging countries. It generally benefits from major trends, in particular decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization. Although Energy Management reported a double-digit order decline, due to a sharply lower volume of large orders in the transmission solutions business, revenue grew in most Division‚Äôs businesses, led by the power distribution businesses. For the latter, on a geographic basis, higher revenue in the region Asia, Australia was partially offset by a decline in the Americas strongly influenced by currency headwinds, while revenue in the region Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East was flat year-over-year.\n",
    "Under the new organizational structure, transmission solutions will be assigned to the Operating Company Gas and Power, while the businesses for power distribution will be assigned to the Operating Company Smart Infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Building Technologies`\n",
    "The Building Technologies Division is a leading provider of automation technologies and digital services for safe, secure and efficient buildings and infrastructures. The Division offers products, solutions, services and software for fire safety, security, building automation and energy management.\n",
    "The Division competes with multinational companies, system integrators, local firms, and IT startups. Strong competition is causing price pressure, especially in the solutions business. Economic changes affect the Division's activities with delay, and particularly in non-residential construction markets, there is a time lag of two to four quarters. Key trends include the demand for energy efficiency and smart space solutions to improve comfort and productivity. In fiscal 2018, the Building Technologies acquired three startups to strengthen its portfolio and expertise. Revenue increased, with the Division‚Äôs revenue growing faster than the market on increases in all reporting regions, with strongest market growth contributions came from the Asia, Australia region, particularly including India. Orders grew in the region Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East, driven by double-digit growth in Germany including multiple multi-year service contracts. The Division won major orders in the U. S. in both periods under review. Profit and profitability remained strong, supported by economies of scale and improved productivity. The markets are expected to grow solidly in fiscal 2019, although U.S. growth may slow slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Digital Factory`\n",
    "The Digital Factory Division provides a wide range of automation products and solutions for manufacturing, including software, control systems, motors, and integrated systems. It also offers lifecycle services and software for design and testing. Changes in customer demand are strongly driven by macroeconomic cycles, leading to variations in profitability. Competition is mainly from large multinational firms offering a relatively broad portfolio, and companies that are only active in certain geographic or product markets. Key trends include rising interest rates, which will limit investment but at the same time make it more focused on improving efficiency, a shift towards regionalization solutions, either to protect local economies or to better adapt solutions to local needs, and an increased focus on digitalization for competitiveness. The Division reported year-over-year growth in orders and revenue, especially in software. Growth was strongest in the Americas and Asia, notably China, and customer investments grew faster than their production, underlining a clear growth momentum relating to automation and digitalization. While the market is expected to continue growing, slower demand is anticipated for 2019 due to the high investment levels of 2018 and rising global trade tensions.\n",

    "`Overall economic conditions`\n",
    "After GDP growth of 3.2% in 2018, it is expected to drop to 2.6% in 2019, as to the U.S.-China trade dispute and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East contributed to uncertainty, which weighed on capital investments. Global exchange of goods started to decline from October 2018, leading to near-stagnation of industrial production afterwards. The decline affected regions reliant on trade and industry, particularly Germany and Italy in Europe, Mexico and Canada in the Americas, and India in Asia. In addition, European economies suffered from continued uncertainties regarding the U. K. leaving the European Union (Brexit) and the budget clash between the European Commission and Italy‚Äôs government, both weighing especially on business investment environment. Countries dependent on commodities and raw material exporting, notably Chile, Brazil and Argentina, saw declines in commodity prices in addition to other adverse factors including domestic political and financial instability. Advanced countries are expected to grow by 1.6%, 0.7 percentage points lower than 2018, while emerging countries will see a decline from 4.6% to 4.1%.\n",
